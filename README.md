# chatbot
This Python script creates a GUI application using tkinter. It imports necessary libraries for natural language processing (NLTK) and Google API. The app defines functions for text preprocessing, generating a response, and processing user input. It includes a text field, submit button, and output label. When the user enters a query and clicks submit, the app preprocesses the input, generates a response based on keywords, or performs a Google search if no keywords match, and displays the response in the output label.
